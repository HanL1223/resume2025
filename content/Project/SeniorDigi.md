## Description
This is a automated task of determining whether a piece of text is a spam or not. In this project, I built a classifier using PyTorch to fine-tune a BERT model.

## Key Takeaways
- Combining DS skill to a real project. Experience on merging model develpment with backend(Django) and frontend(React).
- Collaborative Development. Experience a full-stack project development with a team,and using Github for version control in a team setting
- Agile Management. Here I also exposed to the full agile software development cycle of a product
- Cloud Computing. In-depth knowledge and hands on experience on both AWS(EC2,Route52,S3) and Azure (Machine Learning Studio,Virtual machines)
- New Domain knowledge. First time expose to developing a product in a more public domain setting
